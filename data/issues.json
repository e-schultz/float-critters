      "intro": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of system design, the temptation to build complex, cathedral-like architectures is ever-present. However, experience teaches us that resilience often comes from simplicity, modularity, and the ability to adapt quickly to changing requirements. This collection of foundation patterns focuses on the essential building blocks that enable teams to construct robust systems without falling into the trap of over-engineering.",
